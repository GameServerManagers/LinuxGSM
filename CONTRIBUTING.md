### :video_game: Game Server Specific Issues
LinuxGSM is a management script that acts as a wrapper around game servers. These game servers are developed by different game developers such as Valve, Epic and Facepunch to name a few. 

LinuxGSM has no control over the development and limited knowledge issues directly relating to the game servers themselves. The same also applies for any mods, add-ons, maps etc. 

If there is an issue with a specific game server or mod the best action may be to contact the game/mod developers on there support forums. If it is unclear smoe community members might be able to help . 

A [list](https://docs.linuxgsm.com/support/game-server) of known game developer forums is available on the [LinuxGSM docs](https://docs.linuxgsm.com/support/game-server).

## :computer: Code Contributions
### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain LinuxGSM quality.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible LinuxGSM.
- Enable a sustainable system for LinuxGSM maintainers to review contributions.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing 
<details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
#### Pull Request naming convention
When naming a pull request ensure that it is following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standards; as your pull request commits will be squashed, with the PR subject becoming the commit that is used for generating the [changelog](https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/releases) for the next release.

The pull request subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:

> If applied, this commit will *your subject line here*

For example:

-   If applied, this commit will  _refactor subsystem X for readability_
-   If applied, this commit will  _update getting started documentation_
-   If applied, this commit will  _remove deprecated methods_
-   If applied, this commit will  _release version 1.0.0_
-   If applied, this commit will  _merge pull request #123 from user/branch_

Notice how this doesn‚Äôt work for the other non-imperative forms:

-   If applied, this commit will  _fixed bug with Y_
-   If applied, this commit will  _changing behavior of X_
-   If applied, this commit will  _more fixes for broken stuff_
-   If applied, this commit will  _sweet new API methods_

Below is an example of the subject line for a pull request.
```
feat(alerts): add slack support to alerts
```
```
fix(csgoserver): remove SteamCMD auth requirement 32-bit workaround 
```

 `[WIP]`(Work in Progress).
