All pull requests will now be squashed to create a tidy commit history and simplify changelog creation. You can provide either your own email or a GitHub-provided no-reply email.

When a PR is squashed the author becomes the person who squashed the PR. This removes you as the author of your own PR.
The only workaround for this is to add your details as a co-author. More info about co-authors can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).
