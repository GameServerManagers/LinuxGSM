[LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com) is the command-line tool for quick, simple deployment and management of Linux dedicated game servers.

## Hassle-Free Dedicated Game Servers

## Main features

100+ game servers supported

## :penguin: Compatibility

LinuxGSM will run on popular distros as long as the minimum requirements are met.
