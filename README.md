[LinuxGSM](https://linuxgsm.com) is the command-line tool for quick, simple deployment and management of Linux dedicated game servers.

## Hassle-Free Dedicated Game Servers

Traditionally game servers are not easy to manage yourself. Admins often have to spend hours messing around trying to get their server working. LinuxGSM is a command-line tool designed to be as simple as possible, allowing admins to spend less time on management and more time gaming.

## Main features

100+ game servers supported

-   :truck: Installer
-   :mag: Monitor
-   :phone: Alerts
-   :cloud: Updater
-   :blue_book: Server Details
-   :floppy_disk: Backup
-   :computer: Console

## :penguin: Compatibility

LinuxGSM will run on popular distros as long as the minimum requirements are met.

-   Ubuntu

-   CentOS

Other distros are likely to work but are not fully tested.
